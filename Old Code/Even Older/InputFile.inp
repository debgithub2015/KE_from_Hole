.33 ! exp_step.  The step size for computing the derivatives
!     on the grid is EPSILON**exp_step.  
!     It is reasonable to choose exp_step as large as MAYBE
!     .75.  .25, .33, .5, and .67 are imminently reasonable.
!     If you suspect that your function is ill-conditioned, a
!     smaller step size may give rise to giant round-off errors!!
